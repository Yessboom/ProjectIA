    "## LangChain\n",
    "We use LangChain because it provides a unified, modular framework for building complex AI applications that can **easily switch between different LLM providers without rewriting code**. It offers **powerful abstractions** like chains, agents, and memory that enable developers to create sophisticated workflows such as conversational AI with context, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and autonomous agents that can use tools. Additionally, its **composable architecture (LCEL)** makes it easy to build, test, and maintain complex AI pipelines by breaking them into reusable components that can be combined in different ways."

      "### **Designing Scalable Microservices**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Main Advice:**\n",
      "When designing scalable microservices, prioritize **loose coupling, high cohesion, and resilience** while ensuring the system can handle growth in traffic, data, and complexity. Focus on **autonomy, observability, and fault tolerance** to maintain performance and reliability as the system evolves.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Key Points:**\n",
      "1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**\n",
      "   - Align microservices with business domains (bounded contexts) to ensure clear ownership and minimal inter-service dependencies.\n",
      "   - Use **event-driven architecture** for asynchronous communication where appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Statelessness & Caching**\n",
      "   - Design services to be stateless where possible to enable horizontal scaling.\n",
      "   - Implement **distributed caching** (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Resilience & Fault Tolerance**\n",
      "   - Use **circuit breakers** (e.g., Hystrix, Resilience4j) to prevent cascading failures.\n",
      "   - Implement **retries with backoff** and **fallback mechanisms** for transient failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Scalable Data Management**\n",
      "   - Choose the right database per service (polyglot persistence).\n",
      "   - Use **event sourcing** or **CQRS** for high-write or high-read scenarios.\n",
      "   - Implement **database sharding** or **read replicas** for scalability.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **API & Communication Design**\n",
      "   - Use **RESTful APIs** or **gRPC** for synchronous communication.\n",
      "   - Prefer **event-driven messaging** (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for decoupled interactions.\n",
      "   - Implement **API gateways** (Kong, Apigee) for routing, load balancing, and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Observability & Monitoring**\n",
