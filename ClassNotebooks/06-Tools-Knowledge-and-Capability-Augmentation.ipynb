    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have remarkable capabilities, but they also have fundamental limitations:\n",
    "- **Knowledge cutoff**: Training data ends at a specific date\n",
    "- **No real-time information**: Cannot access current events, live data, or dynamic content\n",
    "- **Mathematical limitations**: Struggle with precise calculations\n",
    "- **No external interactions**: Cannot query databases, call APIs, or browse the web\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangChain Tools** solve these limitations by allowing LLMs to:\n",
    "1. **Augment knowledge**: Access external information sources (web search, databases, APIs)\n",
    "2. **Augment capabilities**: Perform precise operations (calculations, data processing, custom logic)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore both types of augmentation with practical examples using Mistral AI."
