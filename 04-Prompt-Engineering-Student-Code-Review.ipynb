      "   - Always test edge cases (empty list, single-element list, etc.)\n",

      "   - The function name `average` is good, but you might want to add type hints for better documentation\n",

      "2. **Robustness/Edge Cases (25%)**: The function does not handle the empty list case as required. It will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` instead of a `ValueError`.\n",
      "3. **Code Quality/Clarity (20%)**: The code is not clear because it uses `i` (an index) instead of the actual list elements. The variable name `total` is misleading since it doesn't represent the sum of the numbers.\n",
      "4. **Efficiency (10%)**: The function is inefficient because it uses `range(len(nums))` to iterate, which is less Pythonic than directly iterating over the list.\n",

      "### Understanding the Problem\n",
      "\n",
      "We have two stations, Station A and Station B, which are 300 kilometers apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Train 1**: Leaves Station A at 8:00 AM, traveling at 60 km/h towards Station B.\n",

      "We need to determine the time at which these two trains will meet each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Visualizing the Scenario\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's visualize the situation:\n",
      "\n",
      "- At 8:00 AM:\n",
      "  - Train 1 starts from Station A towards Station B at 60 km/h.\n",
      "  - Train 2 is still at Station B; it hasn't left yet.\n",

      "\n",
      "At 9:00 AM:\n",
      "- Train 1 has been traveling for 1 hour at 60 km/h, so it has covered:\n",
      "  - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 km/h × 1 h = 60 km.\n",
      "  - So, at 9:00 AM, Train 1 is 60 km away from Station A towards Station B.\n",
      "  - Therefore, the remaining distance between Train 1 and Station B is:\n",
      "    - Total distance - distance covered by Train 1 = 300 km - 60 km = 240 km.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, at 9:00 AM:\n",
      "- Train 2 starts from Station B towards Station A at 80 km/h.\n",

      "\n",
      "At 9:00 AM, the distance between the two trains is 240 km, and they're closing that distance at 140 km/h.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time taken to meet after 9:00 AM = Distance / Relative Speed\n",

      "\n",
      "To convert 0.714 hours to minutes:\n",
      "0.714 × 60 ≈ 42.857 minutes\n",

      "\n",
      "Adding that to 9:00 AM:\n",
      "9:00 AM + 1 hour = 10:00 AM\n",
      "10:00 AM + 43 minutes ≈ 10:43 AM\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's calculate it more precisely without approximating:\n",
      "\n",
      "12/7 hours = 1 hour + (5/7) hours\n",
      "(5/7) hours = (5/7) × 60 minutes ≈ 42.857 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 1 hour and ~42.857 minutes after 9:00 AM is approximately 10:42:51 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since the speeds are given as whole numbers, it's likely that the exact time is a simple fraction. Let's see:\n",
      "\n",
      "12/7 hours is exactly 1 hour and 42 + 6/7 minutes, which is 1 hour, 42 minutes, and about 51.428 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in practical terms, we can say they meet at approximately 10:43 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's check if we can express it exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alternative Approach: Using Equations\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's define the time from 8:00 AM as 't' hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Train 1:\n",
      "  - Departs at t=0 (8:00 AM).\n",
      "  - Speed: 60 km/h.\n",
      "  - Distance covered by Train 1 at time t: D1 = 60t.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Train 2:\n",
      "  - Departs at t=1 (9:00 AM).\n",
      "  - Speed: 80 km/h.\n",
      "  - Distance covered by Train 2 at time t: D2 = 80(t - 1), for t ≥ 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sum of the distances covered by both trains when they meet should be equal to the total distance between the stations, which is 300 km.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, D1 + D2 = 300\n",
      "60t + 80(t - 1) = 300\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, solve for t:\n",
      "\n",
      "60t + 80t - 80 = 300\n",
      "140t - 80 = 300\n",
      "140t = 300 + 80\n",
      "140t = 380\n",
      "t = 380 / 140\n",
      "t = 38 / 14\n",
      "t = 19 / 7 hours\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, convert 19/7 hours to hours and minutes:\n",
      "\n",
      "19 ÷ 7 = 2 with a remainder of 5, so 2 and 5/7 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "5/7 hours = (5/7) × 60 ≈ 42.857 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, t = 2 hours and ~42.857 minutes after 8:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:00 AM + 2 hours = 10:00 AM\n",
      "10:00 AM + ~42.857 minutes ≈ 10:42:51 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "This matches our previous calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Verifying the Answer\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's verify by calculating the distances covered by each train at t = 19/7 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Train 1:\n",
      "  - Distance = 60 × (19/7) = 1140 / 7 ≈ 162.857 km from Station A.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Train 2:\n",
      "  - Time traveled = t - 1 = 19/7 - 7/7 = 12/7 hours.\n",
      "  - Distance = 80 × (12/7) = 960 / 7 ≈ 137.143 km from Station B.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The two trains will meet at approximately **10:42:51 AM**. However, since the problem likely expects an exact fraction, we can say they meet at **19/7 hours after 8:00 AM**, which is **2 hours and 5/7 hours after 8:00 AM**, or more precisely, **10:42 and 6/7 minutes AM**.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in practical terms, it's reasonable to say they meet at **10:43 AM**.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, looking back at the initial approach where we calculated the time after 9:00 AM as 12/7 hours, which is 1 hour and 5/7 hours, leading to 10:42:51 AM, seems consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, the exact time is **19/7 hours after 8:00 AM**, which is **10:42:51 AM**.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the options or the format might expect a simpler answer, and considering that 19/7 hours is approximately 2.714 hours, which is 2 hours and ~42.857 minutes, the most precise answer is:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The two trains will meet at 10:42 and 6/7 minutes AM.**\n",
      "\n",
      "But in decimal terms, it's approximately 10:42:51 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, and since the problem doesn't specify the format, the exact time is **19/7 hours after 8:00 AM**, which is **10:42:51 AM**.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if we're to present it in a more conventional time format without fractions, we might say:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The two trains will meet at approximately 10:43 AM.**\n",
      "\n",
      "But to be precise, it's exactly at **10:42 and 6/7 minutes AM**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that, and considering that the initial calculation after 9:00 AM was 12/7 hours, which is 1 hour and 5/7 hours, leading to 10:42:51 AM, that seems correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Answer\n",
      "\n",
      "After carefully working through the problem, the two trains will meet at **10:42 and 6/7 minutes AM**, or approximately **10:43 AM**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expressed precisely:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Time after 8:00 AM when they meet:** 19/7 hours (which is 2 hours and 5/7 hours).\n",
      "- **Converted to minutes:** 5/7 hours = 42 + 6/7 minutes.\n",
      "- **Therefore, they meet at:** 10:42 and 6/7 minutes AM.\n",

      "Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to think about the two trains moving towards each other and figure out when and where they'll meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Understanding the Problem\n",
      "\n",
      "We have two stations, Station A and Station B, which are 300 kilometers apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Train 1**: Leaves Station A at 8:00 AM, traveling at 60 km/h towards Station B.\n",
      "- **Train 2**: Leaves Station B at 9:00 AM, traveling at 80 km/h towards Station A.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to determine the time at which these two trains will meet each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Visualizing the Scenario\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's visualize the situation:\n",
      "\n",
      "- At 8:00 AM:\n",
      "  - Train 1 starts from Station A towards Station B at 60 km/h.\n",
      "  - Train 2 is still at Station B; it hasn't left yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "- From 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM (one hour):\n",
      "  - Train 1 is moving towards Station B.\n",
      "  - Train 2 is still at Station B.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 9:00 AM:\n",
      "- Train 1 has been traveling for 1 hour at 60 km/h, so it has covered:\n",
      "  - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 km/h × 1 h = 60 km.\n",
      "  - So, at 9:00 AM, Train 1 is 60 km away from Station A towards Station B.\n",
      "  - Therefore, the remaining distance between Train 1 and Station B is:\n",
      "    - Total distance - distance covered by Train 1 = 300 km - 60 km = 240 km.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, at 9:00 AM:\n",
      "- Train 2 starts from Station B towards Station A at 80 km/h.\n",
      "- Train 1 is at the 60 km mark from Station A, moving towards Station B at 60 km/h.\n",
      "- The distance between the two trains at 9:00 AM is 240 km.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Relative Speed Concept\n",
      "\n",
      "When two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Speed of Train 1: 60 km/h\n",
      "- Speed of Train 2: 80 km/h\n",
      "- Relative speed when moving towards each other: 60 + 80 = 140 km/h\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that the distance between the two trains is decreasing at a rate of 140 km every hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Calculating Time to Meet After 9:00 AM\n",
      "\n",
      "At 9:00 AM, the distance between the two trains is 240 km, and they're closing that distance at 140 km/h.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time taken to meet after 9:00 AM = Distance / Relative Speed\n",
      "= 240 km / 140 km/h\n",
      "= 24/14 hours\n",
      "= 12/7 hours\n",
      "≈ 1.714 hours\n",
      "\n",
      "To convert 0.714 hours to minutes:\n",
      "0.714 × 60 ≈ 42.857 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "So, approximately 1 hour and 43 minutes after 9:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding that to 9:00 AM:\n",
      "9:00 AM + 1 hour = 10:00 AM\n",
      "10:00 AM + 43 minutes ≈ 10:43 AM\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's calculate it more precisely without approximating:\n",
      "\n",
      "12/7 hours = 1 hour + (5/7) hours\n",
      "(5/7) hours = (5/7) × 60 minutes ≈ 42.857 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "So, 1 hour and ~42.857 minutes after 9:00 AM is approximately 10:42:51 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since the speeds are given as whole numbers, it's likely that the exact time is a simple fraction. Let's see:\n",
      "\n",
      "12/7 hours is exactly 1 hour and 42 + 6/7 minutes, which is 1 hour, 42 minutes, and about 51.428 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in practical terms, we can say they meet at approximately 10:43 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's check if we can express it exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Alternative Approach: Using Equations\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's define the time from 8:00 AM as 't' hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Train 1:\n",
      "  - Departs at t=0 (8:00 AM).\n",
      "  - Speed: 60 km/h.\n",
      "  - Distance covered by Train 1 at time t: D1 = 60t.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Train 2:\n",
      "  - Departs at t=1 (9:00 AM).\n",
      "  - Speed: 80 km/h.\n",
      "  - Distance covered by Train 2 at time t: D2 = 80(t - 1), for t ≥ 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sum of the distances covered by both trains when they meet should be equal to the total distance between the stations, which is 300 km.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, D1 + D2 = 300\n",
      "60t + 80(t - 1) = 300\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, solve for t:\n",
      "\n",
      "60t + 80t - 80 = 300\n",
      "140t - 80 = 300\n",
      "140t = 300 + 80\n",
      "140t = 380\n",
      "t = 380 / 140\n",
      "t = 38 / 14\n",
      "t = 19 / 7 hours\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, convert 19/7 hours to hours and minutes:\n",
      "\n",
      "19 ÷ 7 = 2 with a remainder of 5, so 2 and 5/7 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "5/7 hours = (5/7) × 60 ≈ 42.857 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, t = 2 hours and ~42.857 minutes after 8:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "8:00 AM + 2 hours = 10:00 AM\n",
      "10:00 AM + ~42.857 minutes ≈ 10:42:51 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "This matches our previous calculation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Verifying the Answer\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's verify by calculating the distances covered by each train at t = 19/7 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Train 1:\n",
      "  - Distance = 60 × (19/7) = 1140 / 7 ≈ 162.857 km from Station A.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Train 2:\n",
      "  - Time traveled = t - 1 = 19/7 - 7/7 = 12/7 hours.\n",
      "  - Distance = 80 × (12/7) = 960 / 7 ≈ 137.143 km from Station B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding both distances: 162.857 + 137.143 ≈ 300 km, which matches the total distance between the stations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The two trains will meet at approximately **10:42:51 AM**. However, since the problem likely expects an exact fraction, we can say they meet at **19/7 hours after 8:00 AM**, which is **2 hours and 5/7 hours after 8:00 AM**, or more precisely, **10:42 and 6/7 minutes AM**.\n",
